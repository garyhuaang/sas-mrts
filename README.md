✨ [Nx workspace](https://nx.dev) ✨.

To run the dev server for your app, use:

```sh
npx nx serve store
```

To create a production bundle:

```sh
npx nx build store
```

To see all available targets to run for a project, run:

```sh
npx nx show project store
```
Use the plugin's generator to create new projects.

To generate a new application, use:

```sh
npx nx g @nx/react:app demo
```

To generate a new library, use:

```sh
npx nx g @nx/react:lib mylib
```

You can use `npx nx list` to get a list of installed plugins. Then, run `npx nx list <plugin-name>` to learn about more specific capabilities of a particular plugin. Alternatively, [install Nx Console](https://nx.dev/getting-started/editor-setup?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects) to browse plugins and generators in your IDE.
